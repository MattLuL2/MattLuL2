# Hi, I'm Matthew

Game Programming student at Centennial College (expected 2027). I build **C++/C#** projects, Unity games, and **SQL/Web** projects with clean structure and a focus on performance.

## Highlights
- 🎮 Comet’s Climb — a Unity 2D platformer (physics feel, readable code)
- 🧰 C# Utilities — small console apps with unit tests
- 🌐 Responsive website — semantic HTML/CSS/JS, A11y-minded

## Tech
**C++ • C# • SQL • JavaScript • HTML/CSS • Unity • Git/GitHub**
